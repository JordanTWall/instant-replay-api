brainstorm. add oauth to the project eventually. that's easy once you add the basic functionality. GPT DO NOT ADD THIS YET!

sudocode - 

get request from front end containing the team and the year (and eventually auth info.). 

// i only need to perform this request when the user selects the year! 

use db.js connect () to connect to server, 

return data for that team and year to the front end.
